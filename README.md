# Apple-Sales-Analysis-Project Jupyter Notebook
This project aims to analyze sales data for iPhones to uncover trends, insights, and patterns that enhance our understanding of customer behavior and product performance. We will utilize data manipulation and visualization libraries to explore various aspects of the dataset, including pricing, discounts, customer ratings, and reviews.

# Key Questions
 The analysis will address the following questions:
 * What are the top 10 highest-rated iPhones on Flipkart in India?
 * How many ratings do the highest-rated iPhones on Flipkart have?
 * Which iPhone has the highest number of reviews on Flipkart?
 * What is the relationship between the sale price of iPhones and the number of ratings on Flipkart?
 * What is the relationship between the discount percentage and the number of ratings for iPhones on Flipkart?
 * Can we identify the least and most expensive iPhones in the Indian market and their specifications?

# Importing necessary libraries
* import pandas as pd # For data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.

* import numpy as np			# For numerical computing and handling arrays.

* import plotly.express as px 		# For easy and quick interactive visualizations.

* import plotly.graph_objects as go	# For creating customizable and complex visualizations.

# Loading the Dataset
In this section, we will load the dataset containing information about various Apple products, specifically iPhones. This dataset is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, which is commonly used for storing structured data. Using the Pandas library, we will read this CSV file into a DataFrame, allowing us to manipulate and analyse the data efficiently.

## Conclusion

The Apple Sales Analysis Project utilizes data manipulation and visualization libraries, such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, to analyze iPhone sales data on Flipkart in India. Key requirements include:

**Identifying top-rated iPhones** and their reviews.
**Analyzing relationships** between sale price, ratings, and discount percentages.
**Determining the least and most expensive iPhones** along with their specifications.

The insights gained from this analysis will enhance understanding of customer behaviour and inform marketing strategies, ultimately optimizing sales performance in the smartphone market.
