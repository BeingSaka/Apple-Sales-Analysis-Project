# Apple-Sales-Analysis-Project Jupyter Notebook
This project aims to analyze sales data for iPhones to uncover trends, insights, and patterns that enhance our understanding of customer behavior and product performance. We will utilize data manipulation and visualization libraries to explore various aspects of the dataset, including pricing, discounts, customer ratings, and reviews.

# Key Questions
 The analysis will address the following questions:
 * What are the top 10 highest-rated iPhones on Flipkart in India?
 * How many ratings do the highest-rated iPhones on Flipkart have?
 * Which iPhone has the highest number of reviews on Flipkart?
 * What is the relationship between the sale price of iPhones and the number of ratings on Flipkart?
 * What is the relationship between the discount percentage and the number of ratings for iPhones on Flipkart?
 * Can we identify the least and most expensive iPhones in the Indian market and their specifications?
